# Ant A2 walking lab

This fork adapts the browser MuJoCo environment into a baseline walking laboratory for the 12-DOF Unitree A2 quadruped.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [a2.html](a2.html). The application provides passive, standing and diagonal-trot modes, bounded velocity commands, live telemetry and automatic passive fallback on excessive body tilt or low base height. See [the A2 architecture](docs/A2_ARCHITECTURE.md) before connecting any physical hardware.

The simulator uses Unitree's official A2 MJCF properties. The original connectome viewer and fly arena remain available as research references at `index.html` and `arena.html`; they are not part of the A2 controller path.

Jetson 배포 준비: [외장 Jetson 배포 안내](docs/JETSON_DEPLOYMENT.md).
`npm run jetson:doctor`, `npm run jetson:test`, `npm run jetson:pack -- --out deploy/jetson/bundles/toolkit-001`로 시작할 수 있습니다.
현재 A2는 규칙 기반 시뮬레이션이며 학습 완료 모델은 없습니다. 배포 도구는 기본적으로 로봇 명령을 송신하지 않습니다.

A2 Pro 전후방 시야·위험 추적과 오프라인 영상 추론 어댑터: [인식 파이프라인 1단계](docs/A2_PRO_PERCEPTION.md). 시뮬레이터는 가상 객체 입력을 사용하며 실제 영상 AI/센서 연결과 구분합니다.

## Original fly-brain research environment

The complete wiring diagram of a male fruit fly's nervous system is now a file: 165,122
neurons, 104 million synapses. This project runs that file as a spiking brain, inside a
physics-simulated body, in a web browser, and then asks a simple question: which of the
fly's behaviours does the wiring produce on its own, and which had to be added from
outside the graph? The second list turned out to be as interesting as the first.

**Try it:** [arena](https://lulzx.com/fly-brain/arena.html) ·
[connectome viewer](https://lulzx.com/fly-brain/) ·
[algorithmic structures](https://lulzx.com/fly-brain/structures.html) ·
[the textbook](https://lulzx.com/fly-brain/textbook/)
(desktop Chrome, Edge or Firefox; the viewer downloads about 30 MB, the arena about 23 MB)

## Start here

- [What this is](docs/guide/what-this-is.md). One fly is a 165,122-neuron connectome brain
  in a MuJoCo body with a trained compound eye. What the pieces are and why each one is there.
- [Run it](docs/guide/run.md). Two commands to get the arena running locally, and what the
  browser actually loads.
- [The four apps](docs/guide/apps.md). The connectome viewer, the structures page, the arena,
  and the 3D fly.

## How it works

- [What happens every simulated millisecond](docs/guide/loop.md). Senses, brain, motor,
  physics, endogenous behaviour, neuromodulation, courtship, flight. Each stage in a
  paragraph, with the file that implements it.
- [What the wiring gives you, and what it does not](docs/guide/what-the-wiring-gives.md).
  The honest boundary: which behaviours are read out of the connectome and which are
  supplied by code around it.
- [Building the data](docs/guide/pipeline.md). From the raw 10 GB of Janelia tables to the
  27 MB the browser loads, and the calibration and gait fits on top.
- [Headless experiments](docs/guide/experiments.md). Running flies in Node without a browser,
  and the behavioural benchmark suite.

## Going deeper

- [Full documentation index](docs/README.md). Thirty-five documents covering every subsystem,
  the calibration, the limitations and the roadmap.
- [Compiling the Fly Brain](docs/textbook/) is a research monograph on candidate
  computations, connectome-constrained model families, and experiments that distinguish
  them. It separates established biology, recorded model results, and open predictions.
  [Read online](https://lulzx.com/fly-brain/textbook/) or
  [download the PDF](public/fly-brain-textbook.pdf). Executable instructions live in the
  [technical reproduction companion](docs/textbook-reproduction.md).
- [Sources and credits](docs/guide/sources.md). The connectome, the body, the eye, the
  walking data, and the licences.
